To get this working for you:

#1 edit your details in src/constants/info.ts, or if you'll be forking and comitting - crate a \_info.ts and place your stuff there

#2 npm start

#3 enjoy quickly expensing stuff to your company ;)

About the project:
This was done in less than three hours, with the idea to save me time from editing invoices. In the future I might improve the project, but for now it does the bare minimum resulting in an sufficiently good job.
